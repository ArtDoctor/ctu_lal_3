# Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization

This program was implemented as part of the Linear Algebra homework for Czech Technical University course. This is 3rd programming assignment.

## Setup
The programs compile successfully using the https://www.onlinegdb.com environment.  
`numpy` library needs to be installed to run the programs locally.  

## Files
- `utils.py` - user input functions, determinant calculation.  
- `main.py` - main program for performing orthogonalization of vectors using the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization.  
- `example_input.txt` and `run_main_with_txt.sh` - if you don't want to manually input each vector and matrix, you can specify your inputs in the `example_input.txt` file and then run `run_main_with_txt.sh`, or just using `python main.py < example_input.txt`.  
- `test.py` - script to try out multiple inputs and check their outputs.
